However, shipping fees will be deducted from your refund, even if your order qualified for free shipping. This helps balance the cost of returns, as there are additional expenses beyond shipping, such as restocking. For full details, check out our <a href=\"/policies/refund-policy\" title=\"Refund Policy\">refund policy</a>.</p>"

However, sometimes there is no way around international shipments. In many countries, we prepay all applicable taxes and duties and ship \"Delivered Duties Paid\" (DDP), so you won’t have to pay anything upon delivery. On our website, we clearly display whether taxes and duties are already included in the price or may be due upon delivery, based on the location you set up.
