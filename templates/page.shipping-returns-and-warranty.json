However, shipping fees will be deducted from your refund, even if your order qualified for free shipping. This helps balance the cost of returns, as there are additional expenses beyond shipping, such as restocking.<br/><br/>For full details, check out our <a href=\"/policies/refund-policy\" title=\"Refund Policy\">refund policy</a>.</p>"
