In 2018, Core raised $1.6M and reached its goal in just 14 minutes. Today, our wearables are available in 30+ countries, have won “Best in Show” at NAMM, and are used by musicians around the world.<br/><br/>Alongside our hardware, The Metronome app has grown to over 600,000 monthly active users and millions of downloads.<br/><br/>We are proud of what we have built. And we are just getting started.</p>"
